# Breast Cancer Prognosis-AI Campus

This project goes over **survival prediction** using real-world **cancer registry data**, by using techniques in data cleaning, feature selection, and advanced machine learning modeling tailored for **time-to-event data**.

## Project Description

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death. Identifying patients at high risk of poor outcomes is vital for personalized clinical intervention and improving survival rates.

This project focuses on predicting **breast cancer survival** using clinical data derived from the **Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry**. The dataset includes crucial prognostic factors such as **age, tumor size, lymph node status, and hormone receptor status (ER/PR status)**.

Unlike traditional classification, **survival prediction** is a distinctive and complex machine learning task that estimates the **time to an event**, represented by `(outcome, time)` pairs (e.g., survival status and survival months).

The primary objectives are:

1.  Develop a robust prognostic model using advanced machine learning techniques, such as **survival XGBoost** and **survival random forest**, to accurately predict survival probabilities at various time points.
2.  Interpret the models and findings, with feature importance explained using state-of-the-art methods like **survSHAP**.
